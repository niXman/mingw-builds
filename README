The scripts provided by the MinGW-builds project[1][2] are designed
for building the dual-target(i686/x86_64) MinGW compiler for i686/x86_64 hosts.

The scripts are distributed under the 'BSD 3' license[3].

In order to use the scripts provided by the MinGW-builds project it is needed:

1. Windows-64bit or Linux+Wine-64bit

2. Install MSYS: http://tinyurl.com/c2jqh9p

3. Install MinGW for i686 and x86_64 architectures:
  i686: http://tinyurl.com/cd9fvuw
  x86_64: http://tinyurl.com/bw4djo7

4. Get the scripts into <msys root>/home/<user>/mingw-builds:
  "git clone git://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds.git"

5. If you want to compress MinGW binaries and sources in archives, then in
  the <msys root>/home/<user>/mingw-builds/build file set the
  PACK_IN_ARCHIVES variable into 'yes'.

6. In the <msys root>/home/<user>/mingw-builds/build file set the variables,
  for example:
  "x32_HOST_MINGW_PATH=/d/mingw32"
  "x64_HOST_MINGW_PATH=/d/mingw64"

7. In the MSYS file structure delete the '/MinGW' directory.

8. Delete the paths pointining to any preinstalled MinGW from the 'PATH'
  environment variable.

9. Go in to the MinGW-builds root directory.

10. Run:
  "./build gcc-4.6.3 x32" for building i686-MinGW
  "./build gcc-4.6.3 x64" for building x86_64-MinGW
  "./build gcc-4.6.3 x32 x64" for building i686-MinGW and x86_64-MinGW
  "./build --preload gcc-4.6.3 x32 x64" for building i686-MinGW and x86_64-MinGW
  "./build --dwarf gcc-4.6.3 x32" for building i686-MinGW with DWARF exception handling

  The '--preload' option specifies to the script to pre-download all the sources
    and only after that, to begin the building. This allows to build different
    versions of GCC simultaneously.
  The '--download' option specifies to the script to download only the sources.
  The '--dwarf' option specifies to the script to use DWARF exeptions handling
    instead of SJLJ. This allows building for i686 host only, and i686 target only.
  The '--multilib' option specifies to the script to build multilib MinGW.
  The '--rev' option specifies to the script the number of the build revision.

For example, during the process of building of the i686-gcc-4.6.3 will
  be created the following directories:
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-build-x32
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-libs-x32
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-logs-x32
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-x32

For x86_64:
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-build-x64
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-libs-x64
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-logs-x64
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-x64

And the sources directory:
  /mingw-src



The archives with the built MinGW will be created in <msys root>/home/<user>/

At the moment, successfully building the following versions:
  gcc-4.6.2
  gcc-4.6.3
  gcc-4.7.0
  gcc-4.7.1
  gcc-4_6-branch (currently 4.6.4 prerelease)
  gcc-4_7-branch (currently 4.7.2 prerelease)
  gcc-trunk (currently 4.8.0 snapshot)
  cxx-conversion (currently 4.8.0 snapshot)
