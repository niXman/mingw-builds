
The scripts provided by the MinGW-builds project[1][2] are designed
for building the dual-target(i686/x86_64) MinGW compiler for i686/x86_64 hosts.

The scripts are distributed under the 'BSD 3' license[3].

In order to use the scripts provided by the MinGW-builds project it is needed:

1. Windows-64bit or Linux+Wine-64bit

2. Install MSYS: http://tinyurl.com/c2jqh9p

3. Install MinGW for i686 and x86_64 architectures:
  i686: http://tinyurl.com/cd9fvuw
  x86_64: http://tinyurl.com/bw4djo7

4. Get the scripts into <msys root>/home/<user>/mingw-builds:
  "git clone git://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds.git"

5. If you want to compress MinGW binaries and sources in archives, then in
  the <msys root>/home/<user>/mingw-builds/build file set the
  PACK_IN_ARCHIVES variable into 'yes'.

6. In the <msys root>/home/<user>/mingw-builds/build file set the variables,
  for example:
  "x32_HOST_MINGW_PATH=/d/mingw32"
  "x64_HOST_MINGW_PATH=/d/mingw64"

7. In the MSYS file structure delete the '/MinGW' directory.

8. Delete the paths pointining to any preinstalled MinGW from the 'PATH'
  environment variable.

9. Go in to the MinGW-builds root directory.

10. Run:
  "./build gcc-4.6.3 x32" for building i686-MinGW
  "./build gcc-4.6.3 x64" for building x86_64-MinGW
  "./build gcc-4.6.3 x32 x64" for building i686-MinGW and x86_64-MinGW
  "./build --preload gcc-4.6.3 x32 x64" for building i686-MinGW and x86_64-MinGW
  "./build --dwarf gcc-4.6.3 x32" for building i686-MinGW with DWARF exception handling

  The --preload option specifies to the script to pre-download all the sources
  and only after that, to begin the building. This allows to build different
  versions of GCC simultaneously.

For example, during the process of building of the i686 will
  be created the following directories:
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-build-x32
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-libs-x32
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-logs-x32
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-x32

For x86_64:
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-build-x64
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-libs-x64
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-logs-x64
  /mingw-gcc-4.6.3-x64

And the sources directory:
  /mingw-src



The archives with the built MinGW will be created in <msys root>/home/<user>/

At the moment, successfully building the following versions:
  gcc-4.6.2
  gcc-4.6.3
  gcc-4.7.0
  gcc-4_6-branch (currently 4.6.4 prerelease)
  gcc-4_7-branch (currently 4.7.1 prerelease)
  gcc-trunk (currently 4.8.0 snapshot)
  cxx-conversion (currently 4.8.0 snapshot)
