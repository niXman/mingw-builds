1. rewrite usage docs in README for win/nix/osx platforms.
   or, maybe, create separate files for each OS.
   (usage-win.txt, usage-nix.txt, usage-osx.txt)

2. when Python is built, its '<prefix>/lib/python[x.y]' directory contains 'test' directory.
   it is necessary to decide whether it is needed in the python distribution archive, or no.
   if no - in the 'scripts/cleanup.sh' script add the code in order to remove it.

3. Fix building Python with shared NCURSES.

4. Fix building GNU Make with autotools.

5. Use separate archives for languages: 1)c,c++, 2)ada, 3)fortran, 4)obj-c,obj-c++
