Since the 3.0.3 release of gperf (made in May 2007), the generated func
has had the gnu_inline attribute applied to it.  The gcc source however
has not been updated to include that which has lead to a mismatch.

In practice, this hasn't been an issue for two reasons:
(1) Before gcc-5, the default standard was (gnu) C89, and gcc does not
warn or throw an error in this mode.
(2) Starting with gcc-4.8, the compiler driver used to build gcc was
changed to C++, and g++ does not warn or throw an error in this mode.

This error does show up though when using gcc-5 to build gcc-4.7 or
older as then the default is (gnu) C11 and the C compiler driver is
used.  That failure looks like:
In file included from .../gcc-4.7.4/gcc/cp/except.c:990:0:
cfns.gperf: At top level:
cfns.gperf:101:1: error: 'gnu_inline' attribute present on 'libc_name_p'
cfns.gperf:26:14: error: but not here

Whether the compiler should always emit this error regardless of the
active standard or compiler driver is debatable (I think it should be
consistent -- either always do it or never do it).

	* cfns.gperf [__GNUC__, __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__]: Apply the
	__gnu_inline__ attribute.
	* cfns.h: Regenerated.
